# Project Status

This repository presents a **foundational epistemic framework**.

- The core architecture (`EN/formal.md`) is considered **complete**.
- No claims of truth, correctness, or empirical validity are made.
- The framework defines **conditions of operability**, not products or technical implementations.
- The development of concrete systems explicitly belongs to the engineering level and lies outside the scope of this repository.

The project remains open to:
- critique via explicit negation of axioms,
- alternative functional architectures,
- external implementations under explicit restrictions.

At this stage, no additional axioms are planned.
