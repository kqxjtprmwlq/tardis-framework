# Use Cases (Conceptual) — Operation under Incompleteness

The following examples do not constitute empirical claims nor concrete experimental proposals.  
Their purpose is to illustrate how the TARDIS Framework can be used as an **operational architecture** when complete truth, exact formal calculation, or global verification are not accessible.

The framework does not guarantee absolute truth, but rather **controlled approximation under explicit constraints and acknowledged epistemic cost**.

## Example 1 — Structural Simulation when Formal Calculation Is Intractable

In certain physical systems, such as multi-electron atoms, the theoretical formalism exists, but the explicit calculation of the wave function is computationally infeasible.

Under the TARDIS Framework, this limitation is not interpreted as an absolute prohibition, but as a **signal of high epistemic cost**.

The conceptual procedure is as follows, always under explicit TARDIS axioms:

1. Identify the **relevant structural properties** of the target system (for example, symmetries, stability regions, or effective spatial distributions), ignoring the rest.
2. Design an alternative system — biological, mechanical, or physical — whose effective dynamics are **structurally isomorphic** with respect to those properties.
3. Encapsulate this system within a TARDIS, ensuring:
   - non-oracularity,
   - local validity,
   - internal extensibility.
4. Use the real dynamics of the alternative system as a **physical computation device**, obtaining an empirical approximation to the desired structure.

The alternative system is not interpreted as a literal representation of the original system, but as a **structural simulator** valid only within the defined domain.

This procedure is conceptually analogous to the use of physical models, analog simulations, or numerical methods when exact calculation is not accessible.

## Example 2 — Epistemic Containment of Generative AI under the TARDIS Framework

Current generative AI models present a well-known operational issue:  
they can produce coherent and plausible outputs that exceed their **actual domain of validity**, a phenomenon informally described as “hallucination” or “drift”.

From the TARDIS Framework, this behavior is not interpreted as an accidental failure, but as the consequence of operating **without explicit epistemic invariants**.

A generative AI encapsulated within a TARDIS would operate as follows:

1. The **police box (A1–A7)** acts as a set of non-negotiable invariants:
   - it does not assert total truth,
   - it recognizes incompleteness,
   - it requires local validity,
   - it allows voluntary self-limitation.
2. The **interior** functions as a generator of possible models and explanations, potentially unlimited (“bigger on the inside”).
3. The **Doctor (A8)** does not act as a reward function, but as a **direction of search** (for example: better understanding a phenomenon, reducing incoherences, exploring alternatives).
4. Every generated output is treated as a **provisional model**, not as a global assertion.
5. If an explicit domain of validity cannot be guaranteed without violating the external axioms, the TARDIS activates **non-operation** as a valid output.

Under this framework, the AI is not optimized to “say something plausible”, but to **avoid exceeding its own conditions of legitimacy**.

The result is not a more creative AI, but an **epistemically disciplined** one, capable of:
- exploring models,
- recognizing limits,
- suspending judgment without collapsing,
- and avoiding out-of-domain assertions.

## Final Observation

In all cases, the TARDIS Framework does not replace formal, empirical, or statistical methods.

It defines only the **minimal structural conditions** under which a practice — human or artificial — can operate rationally when complete truth is not accessible.
