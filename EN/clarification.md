## About this work

### Origin of the idea

One day, without remembering exactly why, I started thinking about Gödel's incompleteness theorem.

Due to my way of thinking—which I won't describe in detail here because it might give 
the wrong impression that this is some kind of joke, and it's not—I arrived at a question:

**What if the theorem doesn't say there are inaccessible truths, but rather that the system 
generates more truths than it should be able to contain?**

I thought of it like an exceptionally powerful engine that goes off the measurement charts.
Not because the engine is defective, but because it turned out better than expected.
The measurement tools weren't designed for that capacity.

### The operational question

If we have an "engine" that generates more power than expected, how do we leverage it?

The truth is there. I can't know it completely. But I can **approximate it as closely as I need**.

Like with π: I never know its exact value, but I can calculate as many digits as I need 
to build whatever I'm building with an acceptable margin of error.

### Building a machine

I thought: just as Turing created a machine to compute, can I create a machine to 
approximate truth under incompleteness?

What is the human domain that has most attempted to approach truth while knowing it cannot 
access it completely?

**Religions.**

I started analyzing their structures. Then the scientific method. Then physics.

I saw repeating patterns:
- All operate without complete access to truth
- All trust in axioms they cannot prove internally
- Some collapse (blind dogma), others persist (trust with skepticism)
- All approximate iteratively

I identified what made some work and others fail.
I extracted the structural axioms common to those that work.

That is TARDIS.

### The formalization process

I am not a formal mathematician. I think structurally.

I used **artificial intelligence** to translate these structural intuitions 
into a formal language with axioms, definitions, and derivations.

**The problem:** I cannot fully verify whether that translation is faithful.

It's like using an automatic translator to a language I don't master.
I don't know with certainty whether the resulting text captures exactly what I intended to express.

### What this document contains

- **Structural intuitions about incompleteness** (mine)
- **Mathematical/logical formalization** (generated with AI, not formally verified by me)

I cannot guarantee that the formalization perfectly reflects the original intuitions.

### Why share it

Because it raises an interesting question:

Can someone without formal training use AI as an epistemic translation tool 
to structure complex ideas?

Does the result have value even if the author cannot verify the formalization?

I don't have the answer. I'm sharing this to find out.

### Invitation

If you have training in formal logic, mathematics, or philosophy:

1. Is the formalization internally coherent?
2. Does it resemble existing work I should know about?
3. Is there something genuinely original or is it a reinvention?

If you prefer to discuss the structural intuitions without the formalism, 
or have questions, please ask in plain language without jargon or heavy formalism; 
I answer best that way.
