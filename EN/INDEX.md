# Index — TARDIS Framework

This document serves as a **navigation map** for the TARDIS Framework.  
It organizes the documentation and facilitates access to the different components of the framework.

---

## 📖 Quick start

- [**Main README**](../README.md) — Project presentation
- [**Overview**](overview.md) — Non-formal conceptual introduction
- [**Project status**](status.md) — Scope, completeness and openness

---

## 📚 Complete documentation

### 1. Overview (non-formal)
[`overview.md`](overview.md)

Conceptual introduction to the TARDIS Framework: what it is, what it is not, motivation and project philosophy.

---

### 2. Formal specification
[`formal.md`](formal.md)

Complete axiomatic definition:
- External axioms (A1-A7): the "police box"
- TARDIS interior: model generation
- The Doctor (A8): search direction
- Structural derivations (open and complete)
- Isostructure and equimorphism

---

### 3. Conceptual use cases
[`usage_examples.md`](usage_examples.md)

Application cases:
- Structural simulation when formal calculation is intractable
- Epistemic containment of generative AI under TARDIS constraints

---

### 4. Clarifications and context
[`clarification.md`](clarification.md)

Origin of the idea, formalization process, use of AI as an epistemic translation tool.

---

### 5. Project status
[`status.md`](status.md)

- Completeness of the core architecture
- What is inside and outside the scope
- Invitation to critique, verification and implementation

## 🎯 For different profiles

### If you are a mathematician/logician
→ Start with [`formal.md`](formal.md)  
→ Verify derivations, complete the open ones, look for contradictions

### If you are a philosopher/epistemologist
→ Start with [`overview.md`](overview.md)  
→ Analyze the implications of the axioms, critique from the structure

### If you are an engineer/developer
→ Start with [`usage_examples.md`](usage_examples.md)  
→ Think about concrete implementations under TARDIS constraints

### If you are an AI/ML scientist
→ Read [`overview.md`](overview.md) and [`usage_examples.md`](usage_examples.md)  
→ Consider how to encapsulate generative systems under epistemic axioms

## ⚠️ Important warnings

- This framework is **NOT** a theory of the world
- It does **NOT** promise convergence to absolute truth
- It does **NOT** replace existing formal, empirical or statistical methods
- It defines **conditions of operability**, not products or solutions

**This is a foundational framework, not an implementation.**

## 📝 How to contribute

The project is open to:
- **Formal verification** of derivations
- **Completing open derivations** (5.2, 5.3 in formal.md)
- **Implementations** in specific domains
- **Structural critiques** via explicit negation of axioms
- **Alternative functional architectures**

Completeness is not sought, but collaborative development under epistemic rigor.
